# Royal-Editor
This is a beginner-level programming project that involves building a GUI-based text editor using Python's tkinter module. The text editor is capable of editing .txt files. This text editor is a tribute to the history of Royal Enfield, an Indian brand that has become the largest manufacturer of motorcycles, beating Harley-Davidson.

# Setup
To install the necessary dependencies for Royal Text Editor, run the following command in your command prompt:
`pip install pillow os`. To launch the Royal Text Editor, simply run the royal_text_editor.py file using Python. The main window of the application will appear, allowing you to create or open a text file and start editing.

# Features
